## little (useful) userscripts for 2 Idle-Games
#### https://zakuro98.github.io/Spice-Idle/ 
and/or

userscripts are separated for each use and game.

Mostly written for Tampermonkey (bc Greasemonkey is trolling me)

## PPM_at_timestamp

This little helper will add a useful information about the best "Peak per minute at a specific timestamp"
just run a couple of manual Prestige/Ascend/Collapse(if automated), and watch the best "time" to set your automated reset....
if Peak is rising full-time, don't worry, it's not broken ;)
